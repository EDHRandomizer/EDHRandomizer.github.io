## Important Notes

### For Recipients (Windows Users):
1. **Windows SmartScreen Warning**: First-time users may see "Windows protected your PC"
   - This is NORMAL for unsigned executables
   - Click "More info" â†’ "Run anyway"
   - This only happens the first time

2. **Antivirus Software**: Some antivirus programs may flag PyInstaller executables
   - This is a false positive (common with PyInstaller)
   - Add to exceptions if needed

3. **All Files Must Stay Together**: The .exe needs the .csv and .png files to work

### System Requirements:
- Windows 7 or later (32-bit or 64-bit)
- Internet connection (for fetching card images)
- No Python installation needed!

## Building Updates

To rebuild the executable after code changes:

## Optional: Code Signing
To avoid SmartScreen warnings:
